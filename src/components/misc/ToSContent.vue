                The Camino Wallet is built on blockchain technology. Accordingly, by design, and
                practically, the records cannot be changed or deleted and thus are immutable. If you
                made certain personal identifiers publicly available, this may affect your
                availability to exercise your rights, such as your right to be forgotten, or your
                rights to object or restrict the processing of your personal data.

            It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any applicable
            taxes apply to your use of the Camino Wallet, and to withhold, collect, report and remit
            the correct amounts of the referred applicable taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.
            We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether taxes apply, calculate, collect,
            report, or remit any taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction.
